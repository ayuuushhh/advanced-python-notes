This occurrence provides valuable insights into web scraping challenges. The website we're scraping, *Pixelford*, is an example website from *LinkedIn Learning*, used for learning purposes. However, due to high student requests post-course release, the website's server software flagged excessive requests from tools like Python as potentially malicious, causing the blocking of such requests. This is due to the **user agent** information transmitted with web requests, indicating the device and browser being used. Browsers usually provide detailed user agent data, while Python's requests may have a different user agent. This discrepancy leads to the server perceiving Python requests as suspicious.\n",

    "The only practical way to work around is to change the **user agent**'s header data. Changing the **user agent**'s header data will make the computer believe that not any random python user is requesting the information, but a particular user is, which it will not consider malicious (or forbid-worthy). By that it is implied the **user agent**'s token be changed. This can be done by adding the `requests` library's `headers = {'user-agent': '<whatever unique/random name we want for our user>'}` assignment operator to the `.get` request.

    "Our current web scraper is quite impressive. It diligently retrieves blog post titles and displays them in a neat list. However, the blog posts contain more than just titles. Notably, the publication date holds our particular interest. The idea is to exhibit the post's creation date, enabling users to spot new content effortlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon examination, we notice the date lies just below the *a-tag*, which holds the blog post title. It resides within a *time* tag, offering precise details: the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. While a well-formatted \"September 13th, 2019\" is tempting, we can also extract the detailed `datetime` if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan is to revamp our Beautiful Soup code. Instead of targeting *a-tags*, we'll focus on articles (blogs). This approach aligns with our reference to \"blog posts.\" By searching for the *article* tag, we filter content effectively. Our code now captures all the articles, and to fine-tune, we look for the class `type post` within the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we zero in on the title and date within each blog. To access the title, we employ Beautiful Soup's `find` method on the blog element, looking for an *a-tag* with class `entry title link`. The title is extracted and simplified for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing the date proves equally insightful. The date lies within a *time* tag labeled `entry time`. We retrieve this tag and subsequently transform the `datetime` string into a more manageable `datetime` object using Python's built-in `datetime` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `datetime` object now takes center stage. We desire a personalized date representation, and Python's `strftime` method comes to the rescue. This method lets us format the `datetime` as desired. We visit `strftime.org` to comprehend the syntax for customizing the date presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with both the title and the prettified date at hand, we use an F-string to combine them into a cohesive, user-friendly format. This presents a streamlined list of blog posts, complete with dates and titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that web scraping's effectiveness hinges on website consistency. Should the site structure alter, our scraper could falter. However, for targeted use cases, web scraping proves an engaging method to fetch information dynamically."

    "In this guide, the process of creating files in Python is explained using the `open()` function. The function is used to establish a connection to a file, and two parameters are provided: the file name and a mode flag that specifies how the file should be treated. There are three main mode options: 'x' for exclusive creation (only if the file doesn't exist), 'w' for writing (overwriting existing content or creating anew), and 'a' for appending (adding to the end of an existing file). The guide demonstrates the usage of these modes by creating a file named \"cheese.txt\" and writing various content to it. It emphasizes the importance of closing the file using the `close()` method to prevent issues. Additionally, the guide covers the use of the `sys.argv` list to accept command-line arguments for dynamic file naming. By following these steps, users can create and manipulate files in Python according to their specific needs."

The guide starts by discussing the basics of file reading and the use of the `'r'` mode flag, which stands for read.

It also explains how to read the file line by line using a `for` loop. An example challenge is provided, encouraging readers to create a file with numbers and then develop a Python script to read and perform calculations on those numbers.

    "When editing a file in Python, the process involves both reading an existing file and making changes to its content before saving the modified data. This combination of reading and writing is facilitated using the `open()` function. By providing a file path and an appropriate mode, such as 'r+' for both reading and writing, or 'w+' for reading and writing (which clears the file first), you can manipulate the file content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate a preferred method for file editing, a step-by-step approach is outlined. Firstly, the file is read using `file.read()` to retrieve its content and store it in a variable. Next, desired edits are made, such as appending, modifying lines, or inserting new lines. To implement these changes, the file is opened again, this time with 'w' mode, ensuring the previous content is overwritten. Within this stage, each line to be saved is written back using `file.write()`, which can accept a list of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, appending content involves reading the file, performing edits, and then writing the modified content back. Similarly, inserting new lines or modifying specific lines can be accomplished using index manipulation within the list of lines. It's essential to remember adding newline characters when writing lines to ensure proper formatting.\n",
