# Advanced Python Notes

This Jupyter Notebook aims to elucidate concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Functional Programming, Web Scraping, and File Manipulation in Python.

Please feel at liberty to clone this repository and peruse the notebook at your convenience. It is anticipated that the contents herein will provide valuable insights to aid you in your Python journey.

Kindly proceed with the installation of the necessary dependencies on your system, ideally within your designated virtual environment, utilizing the `requirements.txt` file. 

To facilitate this process, kindly execute the subsequent command within your terminal (with the environment activated if you are using one):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This command will ensure the automated installation of all stipulated dependencies. It is important to note this command will only work if you are in the root directory, else you can replace `requirements.txt` with your subjective directory for the file.

Wishing you productive coding ahead!
